# For-Each
  # For-each loop
  * A type of for-loop
  * Loops a set number of times
  * Goes through a list one item at a time
  * Can be used to perform the same action on every item in a list
  # For-each loop structure
  * Clause: 
    *for variable in list:
  * Block: indented underneath clause
  * Variable name is made up when writing loop-clause
  # Define: loop variable
  * Its value changes each loop iteration
  * Becomes each item in the list one by one
  * Can be used in the loop-block to get/alter the item
  * Example:
    *alpha = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    for letter in alpha:
            print(letter)*
  * In the example above, letter = "a" for first loop iteration, letter = "b" for second loop iteration, and so on
  # How can strings be used like lists?
  * Certain list operations can also be performed on strings
  * For-each loops go through each symbol in a string
  * Indexes can get specific symbols in strings
  * in tells whether a symbol is in a string
  * len() gets the length of a string
